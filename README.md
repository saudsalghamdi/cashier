# cashier
This project involves using JavaScript to create a simulation of a cash register. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10,000 to represent the total amount of change that a customer is owed in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR). The program then uses greedy algorithms to determine the minimum number of notes and/or coins to give back to the customer.
